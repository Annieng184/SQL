You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. 
Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.


Solutions:
SELECT s.hacker_id, h.name, sum(score) as total_score
FROM (
    SELECT  hacker_id, 
            challenge_id, 
            max(score) as score
    FROM submissions 
    GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id) s
JOIN hackers h
ON s.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY s.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING total_score >0
ORDER BY total_score desc, s.hacker_id
